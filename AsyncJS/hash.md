Hash: when interacting with the harsh every character i entered make the result different in a unique way but no matter the length of the input the length of the output remained the same and little alteration made alot of changes.

Block: after entering data into a block, i neede to mine the said block in order to be able to make it valid as any more or even slight change after it has been harshed will require me to remine the block.

Blockchain: the blockchain represented multiple blocks connected to each other with their harshes of their predecessors and any change in the previous block affects the integrity of the successor blocks because every block after the edited block would have to be remined to get a valid harsh.

Distributed: the distributed part now mirrors the blockchain as a single instance running on multiple peers which would all have to mirror the same state in order to be valid as any act of malpractice or misinformation would simply be visible as the harshes would differ and the criminal peer would be punished.

Tokens: tokens share actual transcations on the blockchain shared across multiple peers and further butresses the point of the block chain as a distributed public digital ledger that is supposed to mirror the same state on all peers as a slight change of any transcation on any peer will alter the harsh and corrupt the unique nature of the block chain.

Coinbase: the coinbase creates an open, secure and well detailed record of money transfer save across multiple peers and as always a change in any one of the transcations will corrupt the system
